References

Variables hold references/pointers to objects in memory
= only assigns an obect to a variable. Doesn't mutate the object

Mutable: String, Array, Hash
Immutable: Int, Float, Symbol

<< vs concat vs +=
[1,2] << [3] => [1,2,[3]]
[1,2].concat([3]) => [1,2,3]
+= acts similiarly to concat but creates a new array object
<< modifys original object

block scope of local variables
inside a do..end block you have access to all variables declared previously at the same or an outer-level scope
cannot access variables declared in a block outside of it
changes made in a block to a variable declared outside of it will persist

Scope gates
parts of code where a new scope is created and all local variables previously defined can't be accessed
scope gates: method definition, class definitions, modules definitions

paramater vs argument
Parameter: variable in a method definition
Argument: variable method is invoked with

passing arguments to methods
in the scope of a method the param is a copy of the arg that the method was invoked with
if we reassign the param within the method the arg we called the method with is unaffected
if we mutate the parameter object the argument is affected
